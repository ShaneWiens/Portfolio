# Portfolio
This is a sample of my work, to be developed over time.


##Objective
The goal in creating this application was to attempt to apply my new CSS knowlegde along with proper HTML format usage. 
While I was mostly successful in creating and deploying the page, I was able to identify some areas for further study.
I feel comfortable creating and styling containers, but resizing for smaller screens eludes me.
